# QueenSnopea's MMR Music
Custom music I've sequenced (so far entirely from scratch) for use in Majora's Mask Randomizer. Click the song name to download the mmrs, the ▶️ next to it to download a preview, or the 📺 to open it on YouTube. If a song name is listed with no links, then it means I'm finished with transcribing the song but haven't gotten it in the game yet.

Credit to [Oceanity](https://github.com/Oceanity/Oceanitys-MMR-Music/) for the inspiring the organization used in this readme 😅

## 🚧 Works in Progress 🚧
I thought it would be nice to share which songs I've started but not finished here too, but I've got far to many unfinished projects so I'm making a separate section here for that list so it doesn't clog up the more important download information. I'll attach links to YouTube uploads of the original versions with a 🎧 in case anyone is curious in the meantime.

#### A Hat in Time
- Title Theme [🎧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQrYhnR-qu8)
- No More Mafia Boss [🎧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcuXHfAUHvM)

#### Dustforce
- 9-Bit Expedition [🎧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO7FlB_xpzw)
  - This one is obviously not suited to MM's set of available instruments, but I'd like to get something working if I can.
- It's Not Supposed To Be Snowing [🎧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kluv-1SVIbg)
- The Magnetic Tree [🎧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fBQDzRvCTs)

#### Katamari Damacy
- Lonely Rolling Star [🎧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_QydNXI_ok)
  - Similar to 9-Bit Expedition, I'm not sure if I'll be able to come up with a sound that satisfies me because of MM's instrument set but I want to try.

#### Monster Hunter: World
- Seliana Theme (Night) [🎧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj9BL8VjrpA)

#### Splatoon
- Eight-Legged Advance [🎧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0y9gCHAJkk)

#### Webbed
- Hello, Little Spider [🎧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktcGfGW3KrA)
  - Almost done with this one, and it'll be a dynamic track that brings the bass/drums in when near enemies/on Epona/etc.
