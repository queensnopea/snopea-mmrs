# QueenSnopea's MMR Music
Custom music I've sequenced (so far entirely from scratch) for use in Majora's Mask Randomizer. Click the song name to download the mmrs, the ▶️ next to it to download a preview, or the 📺 to open it on YouTube. If a song name is listed with no links, then it means I'm finished with transcribing the song but haven't gotten it in the game yet.
